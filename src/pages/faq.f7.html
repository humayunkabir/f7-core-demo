                    COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common
                    in people and many different species of animals, including
                    camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses
                    can infect people and then spread between people. This
                    occurred with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and now with the virus
                    that causes COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a
                    betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of
                    these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from
                    U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially
                    posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this
                    virus from an animal reservoir. However, the exact source of
                    this virus is unknown.

                    Virus.

                    On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced
                    an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019
                    novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
                    The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019,
                    abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, 'CO' stands for
                    'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease. Formerly,
                    this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or
                    “2019-nCoV”.

                    There are many types of human coronaviruses including some
                    that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses.
                    COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new)
                    coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The
                    name of this disease was selected following the World Health
                    Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal iconexternal icon
                    for naming of new human infectious diseases.

                    No, antibiotics do not work against viruses. The 2019-nCOV
                    is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should not be used as
                    a means of prevention or treatment.
